- Update Manual

- A bond can be deactivated, but nothing happens until "generate" button is pressed.
  However, if the session is saved and reloaded, it is as if the "generate button was pressed.
  Deactivated bonds dissapear.
  
- Scroll bars should be added to bond and parameter windows.

- menu names could be changed/reogranized.

- Code could be reogranized to 1) fit MVC 2)organize GUI Main into several files.

-minor, but in Session file, line ~951, it seems that translating the atom back to the first cuttoff cell should
be unneccessary since it must exist as an internal-cellular bond to have translated to an intercellular bond.

-inter-cellular bonds are not generated for the monte carlo if the original cut-off cell does not include them,
ie. if the cutoff cell has one or more dimensions of just one unit cell.

-refactor code to remove circular imports.  Right now, there is an import from fitting in the middle of the GUI Main file.
There are also impotrs in the middle of the fitting and processes files.

-Look into safe ways of killing processes.  Right now, the terminate() method is used, which has the potential to
corrupt the queue if it is being accessed when the process is terminated.
